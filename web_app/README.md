## Troubleshooting

### Step 1: Check Browser Console
Open your browser's developer console (F12) to see detailed error messages and debug information.

### Audio Recording Issues
1. **Browser Permissions**: Make sure your browser allows microphone access
2. **HTTPS Required**: Some browsers require HTTPS for microphone access (try http://localhost)
3. **Browser Compatibility**: Try Chrome or Firefox first
4. **Microphone Check**: Verify your microphone works in other applications

### Audio Processing Errors
1. **Dependencies Missing**:
   ```bash
   python check_deps.py  # Check what dependencies are available
   python install_deps.py  # Install missing dependencies
   ```

2. **FFmpeg Not Found**: If pydub fails, install ffmpeg:
   - Windows: Download from https://ffmpeg.org/download.html and add to PATH
   - macOS: `brew install ffmpeg`
   - Linux: `sudo apt install ffmpeg`

3. **File Format Issues**: The app automatically converts WebM/MP4 to WAV
   - Check browser console for conversion errors
   - Verify that temporary files are being created/cleaned up

### Video Playback Issues
- Videos must be in MP4 format
- Check that video files exist in the `../faq-video-poc/videos/` directory
- Ensure video filenames match the `answer__url` column in `faq.csv`

### Search Issues
- Make sure ChromaDB is properly initialized
- Check that `../faq-video-poc/data/faq.csv` exists and is properly formatted
- Verify that the FAQ search engine can find relevant matches

### Debug Tools
- **Browser Console**: Check for JavaScript errors (F12)
- **Server Logs**: Look at Flask console output for backend errors
- **Network Tab**: Check if API requests are successful

## Browser Compatibility

- ‚úÖ Chrome (recommended)
- ‚úÖ Firefox
- ‚úÖ Safari
- ‚úÖ Edge

**Important**: Allow microphone access when prompted by your browser.
